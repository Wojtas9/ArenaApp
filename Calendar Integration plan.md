Based on the screenshots provided, I can see that you already have the application structure with the green sidebar navigation and white main content area. Let's refine the plan to focus specifically on adding the Calendar functionality to your existing application.

## Phase 1: Setup and Integration

1. **Add Calendar Navigation Item**
   - Add a Calendar button to the existing sidebar navigation
   - Use the same styling as the existing navigation items (Dashboard, Folders, Settings)
   - Include the appropriate calendar icon to match the design

2. **Install FullCalendar and Dependencies**
   - Install FullCalendar core and required plugins:
     ```bash
     npm install @fullcalendar/core @fullcalendar/daygrid @fullcalendar/timegrid @fullcalendar/interaction @fullcalendar/list
     ```
   - Add any additional styling libraries if needed

## Phase 2: Calendar Component Implementation

1. **Create Calendar View Component**
   - Create a new component for the calendar view
   - Implement routing to display the calendar when the Calendar nav item is clicked
   - Set up the basic container with proper padding and styling to match existing UI

2. **Implement Calendar Header**
   - Create the header with "April 13-19, 2020" format
   - Add previous/next navigation arrows
   - Implement "Week 16" indicator
   - Add the purple "Create" button in the top-right corner

3. **Implement Mini Month Calendar**
   - Create the small month calendar view (April 2020)
   - Style it to match the design with proper day abbreviations
   - Implement date selection functionality

## Phase 3: Main Calendar Implementation

1. **Configure Week View Calendar**
   - Set up the week view with days of the week and dates (13-19)
   - Implement the time grid with hourly divisions (8:00 - 18:00)
   - Configure proper time format and display

2. **Style Calendar Elements**
   - Match the clean, minimalist design from the screenshot
   - Implement proper spacing and alignment
   - Use the correct font styles and colors

3. **Implement Event Display**
   - Create vertical event blocks with category colors
   - Add time indicators on events
   - Style events with rounded corners and proper spacing

## Phase 4: Categories and Event Management

1. **Implement Categories Section**
   - Create the "Categories" section with color-coded categories:
     - Product Design (green)
     - Software Engineering (blue)
     - User Research (green)
     - Marketing (red)
   - Add checkboxes for filtering events by category

2. **Create Event Details Panel**
   - Implement the event details panel as shown at the bottom
   - Add fields for title, time, coach/instructor, and venue
   - Style it to match the design with proper spacing and typography

3. **Implement Prioritization Features**
   - Create the "Prioritize" section with:
     - Eisenhower Matrix option
     - Eat The Frog First option
   - Add expandable functionality with arrow indicators

## Phase 5: Database Integration

1. **Design Database Schema**
   - Create tables for events, categories, and user preferences
   - Set up relationships between tables
   - Implement migrations if using a framework

2. **Create API Endpoints**
   - Implement CRUD operations for events
   - Add endpoints for category management
   - Create filtering and search functionality

3. **Connect Calendar to Backend**
   - Implement data fetching from API
   - Set up event creation/editing/deletion with API calls
   - Add proper loading states and error handling

## Phase 6: Event Interaction Features

1. **Implement Event Creation**
   - Create the "Create" button functionality
   - Design an event creation form
   - Implement validation and error handling

2. **Add Event Interaction**
   - Implement drag-and-drop for events
   - Add resize functionality for event duration
   - Create detailed event modals/popovers on click

3. **Implement Event Filtering**
   - Connect category checkboxes to event filtering
   - Add date range filtering
   - Implement search functionality

## Phase 7: Testing and Deployment

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test calendar functionality across different browsers
   - Verify all CRUD operations work correctly
   - Test edge cases (timezone handling, long events, etc.)

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize rendering for large datasets
   - Implement lazy loading for events
   - Minimize unnecessary re-renders

3. **Final Review and Deployment**
   - Conduct final code review
   - Prepare deployment strategy
   - Deploy to production environment

This refined plan focuses specifically on adding the Calendar functionality to your existing application structure, without recreating components that are already implemented.
