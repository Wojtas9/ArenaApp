Based on the issues identified, I'll create a comprehensive plan to fix the calendar functionality. The main problems include: event creation not working properly, mini calendar display and navigation issues, main calendar header not showing current week/year, timezone discrepancy causing events to display 2 hours later than database records, and event detail modal positioning problems. I'll divide the solution into phases focusing on each specific issue, starting with fixing the event creation modal implementation.

# Calendar Functionality Improvement Plan

After examining the code, I've identified the key issues with the calendar functionality and developed a comprehensive plan to address them. Here's a breakdown of the problems and the proposed solutions:

## Phase 1: Fix Event Creation Modal

The main issue is that there are two separate event creation modals in the codebase:
1. One defined directly in `index.blade.php` (lines 59-81)
2. Another included via `@include('calendar.create-event-modal')` at the end of the file

This duplication is causing conflicts, and the JavaScript is likely trying to interact with elements that don't exist in the expected context. Additionally, the instructor dropdown is missing from the implementation.

**Solution:**
- Remove the duplicate modal from `index.blade.php`
- Ensure the included `create-event-modal.blade.php` is properly referenced
- Fix the JavaScript event handlers to target the correct modal elements
- Add missing API call to load instructors

## Phase 2: Fix Mini Calendar Display and Navigation

The mini calendar is not displaying properly and the navigation buttons aren't working. The issue appears to be with the initialization of the mini calendar and its event handlers.

**Solution:**
- Fix the mini calendar initialization to use the correct FullCalendar plugin
- Ensure the mini calendar displays the current month by default
- Properly connect the navigation buttons to the mini calendar
- Fix the styling to ensure the mini calendar is visible

## Phase 3: Fix Main Calendar Header Display

The main calendar header is not showing the current week and year. The issue is in the function that updates the header date.

**Solution:**
- Fix the `updateHeaderDate` function to correctly display the current week and year
- Ensure the function is called when the calendar is initialized
- Connect the navigation buttons to update the header correctly

## Phase 4: Fix Time Zone Discrepancy

Events are displaying 2 hours later than their database records, which indicates a time zone handling issue.

**Solution:**
- Fix the time zone handling in the event creation and display logic
- Ensure consistent time zone handling between the server and client
- Adjust the event time display to account for the time zone difference

## Phase 5: Fix Event Detail Modal Positioning

The event detail modal is appearing under the page content instead of on top of it.

**Solution:**
- Fix the z-index and positioning of the event detail modal
- Ensure the modal is properly displayed when an event is clicked
- Add proper overlay to prevent interaction with the page content when the modal is open

## Implementation Strategy

For each phase:
1. Identify the specific code sections that need to be modified
2. Make targeted changes to fix each issue
3. Test each fix individually to ensure it works as expected
4. Integrate all fixes and test the complete solution

This approach will systematically address all the identified issues while minimizing the risk of introducing new problems.

The most critical issue to address first is the event creation modal, as this is preventing users from creating new events. Once that's fixed, we can proceed with the other phases in order of importance.
